# VL.Wekinator

[The Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/) is a standalone software that uses machine learning to solve the following problem: given input X, I want to get output Y. Where X can be any input that can be expressed as a series of floats and the output can either be:

- Discrete categories, like "Pose 1", "Pose 2", ...
- Continuous numeric outputs referring to positions between discrete outputs
- Recognition of gestures over time (like drawing a circle with your mouse)

Besides sending input data and receiving outputs data from The Wekinator, this plugin also allows you to easily control the software from your patch : you can trigger the recording of new examples, train your dataset and run with simple nodes.
